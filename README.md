# Eye_Tracking
This Python program captures real-time gaze data using a webcam and the GazeTracking library. The user is prompted to enter their personal details through a GUI built with Tkinter, and gaze data is collected over a set period of time (30 seconds). The gaze data, along with the user information, is then saved to an Excel file for further analysis.
